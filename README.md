# CSVPageRankEditor.rb

This model accepts relationship and node .csv files as input (they have to be of all the same type of node) and outputs an edited node file. The new node file has the pagerank feature entered as a new column for each node. 

The program doesn't generate the .csv files used for input, these have to be generated by either querying PGAdmin or Neo4j or some other database. 

# Pregel

Single-node implementation of Google's Pregel framework for graph processing. It does not provide any of the distributed components, but implements the core functional pieces within a single Ruby VM such that you can develop and run iterative graph algorithms as if you had the full power of Pregel at your disposal.

To learn more about Pregel see following resources:

 * [Large-scale graph computing at Google](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/large-scale-graph-computing-at-google.html)
 * [Phoebus](http://github.com/xslogic/phoebus) is a distributed Erlang implementation of Pregel

# PageRank example with Pregel
To run a PageRank computation on an arbitrary graph, you simply specify the vertices & edges, and then define a compute function for each vertex. The coordinator then partitions the work between a specified number of workers (Ruby threads, in our case), and iteratively executes "supersteps" until we converge on a result. At each superstep, the vertex can read and process incoming messages and then send messages to other vertices. Hence, the full PageRank implementation is:

```ruby
class PageRankVertex < Vertex
  def compute
    if superstep >= 1
      sum = messages.inject(0) {|total,msg| total += msg; total }
      @value = (0.15 / num_nodes) + 0.85 * sum
    end

    if superstep < 30
      deliver_to_all_neighbors(@value / neighbors.size)
    else
      halt
    end
  end
end
```

The above algorithm will run for 30 iterations, at which point all vertices will mark themselves as inactive and the coordinator will terminate our computation.
